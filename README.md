# E-Commerce Project

This is an e-commerce project built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/), and [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [here](https://nextjs-ecommerce-ten-beta.vercel.app/).

## Development

To get started with development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the directory.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up Prisma by running `npm run postinstall`.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

After running the server, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

The main application file is `app/page.tsx`. Changes made in this file will automatically update on the page.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for automatic font optimization and loading of Inter, a custom Google Font.
